# Introduction

At GreenSync, we consume data from many sources and in varied formats; one common format we receive data in is ‘comma separated values’ or CSV. Today we’re providing you with three CSVs containing data to process.

The first (`data/01-solar_generation.csv`) is the electricity generation data for a series of customers’ rooftop solar installations. Each row in the CSV contains the following information:

* `time` - The time that the reading was taken
* `power_real` - The power output from panels at the given time in __watts__
* `house_id` - Customer house id

__Hint__:
If your are reading the following values from a 'solar generation file'

```csv
07:05:00,902,1
07:10:00,1072,1
07:15:00,1157,1
07:20:00,1250,1
07:25:00,1359,1
07:30:00,1514,1
07:35:00,1738,1
```

Then the timestamp _07:10:00_ and the value _1072_ represents the average power output in watts between _07:05:00_ and _07:10:00_


The second CSV (`data/02-consumption.csv`) is the electricity usage data for a typical customer in the area and includes the following:

* `period` - The 30 minute block that the data is for
* `usage` - The energy consumed in the period in kilowatt hours

The third CSV (`data/03-household_information.csv`) contains information about each house:

* `house_id` - The customer house id
* `number_of_occupants` - Number of occupants in the house
* `cost_per_kilowatt_hour` - What the customer pays per kWh consumed

# Requirements

Write a program that prints out two small reports:

First, the total amount of electricity generated and the total amount of electricity consumed for each house

 EG:
 ```text
 House <id> generated 20000Wh of electricity
 House <id> consumed 40000Wh of electricity

 House <id> generated ...
 House <id> consumed ...
 ```

To calculate the electricity generated in watt hours by the solar panels, find the sum of (instantaneous value in watts x period duration in hours) for each house. This part trips a number of applicants up which is not what we are trying to do. So please review the following example to understand how to calculate the energy generated in Wh (watt hours)

```csv
07:05:00,902,1,  in Wh = 902 watts * (5/60)
07:10:00,1072,1, in Wh = 1072 watts * (5/60)
07:15:00,1157,1, in Wh = 1157 watts * (5/60)
07:20:00,1250,1, in Wh = 1250 watts * (5/60)
07:25:00,1359,1, in Wh = 1359 watts * (5/60)
07:30:00,1514,1, in Wh = 1514 watts * (5/60)
07:35:00,1738,1, in Wh = 1738 watts * (5/60)
```

To calculate the amount of energy consumed, find the sum of the typical energy consumed in the 48 periods for a house in the area.

Secondly, the average cost of energy usage per person for each house (ignore the electricity generated by the solar panels):

```text
    House id: <id> averaged $5.25 per person
    House id: ...
```

NOTE: If the language you’re using does not contain a built in library for reading CSVs, simply split each line where there is a comma rather than using a third party library.
